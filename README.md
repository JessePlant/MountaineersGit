# Mountaineers

## Implementation
* For the menu icons we used art from OpenGameArt
* For the player movement we expanded on the code by [Jasper Flick](https://catlikecoding.com/jasper-flick/).
* We used our own sound.
* We designed our own art and we also used AI to generate the characters and enemies.
* The rest of the logic was done by us including the movement of the zombies
